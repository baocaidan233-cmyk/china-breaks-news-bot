"""
China Breaks — a CCP-exposure Gettr news feed, built by porting AM1ST's
current, fully-evolved Python architecture (RSS ingestion -> dedup ->
scoring -> extraction -> content-gen -> Gettr publish) to a new domain.
AM1ST itself is a from-scratch rebuild of an n8n workflow; China Breaks is
instead ported from AM1ST's OWN Python code (not from any n8n export) —
see README for the full lineage and the real Notion/Redis/Gettr facts
carried over from China Breaks' existing, still-running n8n system
(v4.0_chinabreaks_news_to_notion_branch2.json for ingestion,
v3.4_chinabreaks_notion_to_gettr.json for publishing), which this Python
port is meant to eventually replace — not yet, as of this build.

This is the INGESTION cycle only, mirroring AM1ST's own two-cycle design:
this cycle's job ends at writing a candidate into the shared Notion
candidate pool; main_publish.py is the separate, independently-scheduled
process that later reads that pool and decides what (if anything)
actually gets posted.

Pipeline order per cycle (cheapest filter first — mechanism identical to
AM1ST, only the domain and a handful of tuning numbers differ, see
core/config.py):
  load sources (Notion) -> fetch RSS (UTC-normalized, max_publish_age_hours
  publish-age filter, no per-feed or cross-source caps) -> URL-hash Redis dedup
  -> intra-batch semantic CLUSTERING (title+description; groups this
  batch's own candidates into local event clusters, not just a drop/keep
  decision — see Layer 2 below) -> per cluster: read-only peek at
  core/qdrant_store.py's EventStore (a separate Qdrant collection tracking
  heat_score/event_first_seen_at per underlying event, not per article),
  then a second opinion on that cosine match via core/event_identity.py
  (entity-overlap rule tier, LLM only for the residual ambiguous tier —
  cosine similar is not the same claim as same real-world event) for a
  heat_score PREVIEW to feed the AI score gate, plus per-candidate
  cross-cycle Qdrant dedup (vs title+description written in the last 72h)
  -> AI score gate (gpt-4o-mini, >=4) -> for each cluster with at least
  one scoring survivor: COMMIT that cluster's accumulated heat/sources to
  the EventStore (a cluster where nothing cleared the score gate never
  touches it at all) -> write survivors to Notion candidate pool ->
  Qdrant embedding write (the same title+description embeddings used for
  clustering, now persisted for future cross-cycle checks).

Full-text extraction and content generation are deliberately NOT part of
this cycle (same reasoning AM1ST arrived at — see agents/extractor.py's
docstring): every candidate that merely cleared the cheap
title+description score gate would otherwise pay for a full extraction +
LLM-written post, even though only a handful per 30-min publish cycle
would ever actually get posted before aging out of the 12h
candidate-pool window.

Usage:
  python3 main.py              # normal run
  python3 main.py --dry-run    # logs what would be added, never writes to Notion/Qdrant

    # 2026-08-14 P0 redesign (event-identity research memo — see
    # project memory) — three changes from the original single-Top-1 design:
    #   1. Walks up to entity_verifier.top_k historical event candidates
    #      (cosine-descending), not just the single most-similar one — the
    #      true match can rank #2+ if the top-ranked candidate is a
    #      coincidentally-closer but actually-unrelated event (see
    #      EventStore.peek_top_k()'s docstring). Stops at the first
    #      accepted SAME_OCCURRENCE; a rejected candidate no longer ends
    #      the search.
    #   2. Every candidate resolves to one of three verdicts —
    #      SAME_OCCURRENCE (accept, stop), RELATED_DIFFERENT_EVENT
    #      (entity-related but a distinct action, e.g. "condemns the
    #      launch" vs the launch itself — recorded as a breadcrumb, keep
    #      walking), UNRELATED (zero entity overlap, no breadcrumb, keep
    #      walking) — this is what the old NO_OVERLAP/AMBIGUOUS-LLM-
    #      DIFFERENT split already did implicitly, just now against
    #      multiple candidates and explicitly labeled as such in the log.
    #   3. Once SAME_OCCURRENCE is accepted, EventVerifier.classify_subtype()
    #      (existed since 2026-08-09, never actually called before this)
    #      weights how much this cluster's corroboration should move the
    #      matched event's heat_score — a real new fact (CORE_UPDATE)
    #      moves it more than an outlet just repeating yesterday's line
    #      (RESTATEMENT). Real added cost: one extra small LLM call per
    #      accepted match, including the previously-free COMPATIBLE/
    #      FAIL_OPEN rule-tier resolutions — deliberate, since heat
    #      weighting should apply uniformly regardless of which tier
    #      accepted the match. Does NOT touch canonical_title/
    #      canonical_summary/timeline state — those stay seed-only/never-
