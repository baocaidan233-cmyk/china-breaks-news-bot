"""Train the Layer 1.55 pre-score model — see core/prescore.py.

Labels come from two places because this channel keeps them in two places:
a candidate the Scorer rejected leaves a line in main.log carrying its URL,
its score and (since 2026-09-28) its title, and one it accepted is a row in
the Notion candidate database. Neither half alone can train this: Notion has
only positives, and before 2026-09-28 the log line had no title.

That split is also why this trains on a window rather than on everything.
The negatives start when the title was added to the log line, so rows older
than the first negative are dropped -- keeping them would hand the model a
stretch of history containing positives and no negatives, and it would learn
the calendar.

The threshold is the lowest out-of-fold probability among training rows at
or above the gate, so the model would not have skipped a single one of them.
It is a minimum, not a percentile: one mislabelled row can only make it
lower and skip less, never make it skip something it should have kept.

Run:  ./.venv/bin/python tools/train_prescore.py --out models/prescore.json
      (needs scikit-learn, which only training needs — core/prescore.py
      reads the model with numpy alone.)
