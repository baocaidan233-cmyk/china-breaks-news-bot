# Donald Trump is the sitting president. A caption that calls him a former one
# is wrong on its face, and it is the single error this channel cannot ship.
#
# Deliberately a dedicated check on the caption alone, separate from
# agents/candidate_selector.py's filter_former_trump(). That one exists for a
# different job -- it screens the source article and its metadata, so it also
# catches a stale re-synced piece -- and it matches fixed substrings, which
# misses every variant that is not in its list. This one is the last gate on
# the text we are about to publish under our own name, so it is a pattern
# rather than a list: 6 fixed strings cannot cover a phrasing this open-ended,
# and a miss here is a published post.
#
# Measured 2026-09-27 over 672 published posts: zero occurrences. The check is
# insurance against the writer, which is told "always President Trump" but can
# still fall back on training-data habit, not a fix for an observed rate.
#
# What it must NOT block, because these are correct:
#   "President Trump"                    -- the plain current-tense title
#   "then-President Trump"               -- his first term, correctly marked
#   "Trump's former adviser"             -- former attaches to someone else
#   "the former president, Joe Biden"    -- former attaches to someone else

# somebody else: "a former POTUS aide" is an aide to some past president, and
# "the former president's adviser" is that president's adviser. Neither says
# anything about who holds the office now. The named patterns above need no
# such guard, because they require Trump's name in the title's own slot.
