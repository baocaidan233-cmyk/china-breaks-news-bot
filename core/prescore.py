"""Embedding pre-score (2026-09-30) — skips the Scorer, and everything
between it and here, for a candidate whose title is very unlikely to reach
the pool gate.

Ported from AM1ST, where it has run since 2026-09-29. The mechanism is the
same and every number is this channel's own: the model is fitted on this
channel's logged scores, and the threshold is the lowest out-of-fold
probability among its own rows at its own gate, so nothing in the training
window would have been skipped.

Two things matter more here than they did there. This channel is multilingual,
so title_word_count below counts two CJK characters as one unit -- a single
\\w+ count reads a whole Chinese headline as one or two "words" and would have
sent 12.9% of this channel's titles down the short-title pass-through, the
most substantial ones among them. And the pool gate is the same 5.0, but the
material reaching it is wire copy that runs a few hundred characters, so the
model has less text to judge from than AM1ST's does.

Kept from AM1ST deliberately: the threshold is a minimum and not a percentile,
so a mislabelled row can only make it skip less; every safety layer can only
keep a candidate; an unreadable model file skips nothing; and a fixed share of
candidates, chosen by url_hash before the model looks, is always scored so
that P(skipped | reaches the gate) can be measured at all -- a skipped
candidate has no score, so no other sample can say what a skip costs."""
