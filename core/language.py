"""English-only language guard — China Breaks is an English-only channel,
same posture as AM1ST (this codebase's own architecture origin), but
nothing by itself verifies that either a candidate's own title/description
or its underlying article text is actually English. Ported unchanged from
AM1ST, where it was added after a real published post turned out to be a
non-English-language Reuters article that the writer tried, and failed,
to self-censor via a "No comment" reply — relying on the writer's own
judgment alone isn't robust enough; this is an explicit, code-level check
that doesn't depend on the model noticing and correctly signaling it. For
a CCP-exposure feed whose sources may often carry Chinese-language
originals, this check plausibly matters at least as much as it did for
AM1ST — ported here as a preventive measure from day one, not added after
this bot's own incident.

Also includes a CJK-ratio pre-check: langdetect scores a whole string's
dominant language by character n-gram statistics, so a Chinese headline
translation concatenated with its (long) English original — e.g. "习惯高油
价吧 - Get Used to High Gas Prices" — reads as majority-English and passes
detect() as "en" even though the leading clause is genuinely Chinese.
AM1ST checked this against 3547 real historical candidates from its own
feed: every case with any Han/Kana/Hangul content at all landed at a
CJK-letter ratio of 0.133 or higher, and every pure-English candidate
landed at exactly 0 — no observed case in between — so the 0.05 threshold
below has wide margin on both sides of that real split. Not
independently re-validated against China Breaks' own feed, which, being
China-focused, may see CJK-mixed text more often than AM1ST's did —
worth revisiting once this weekend's live test data exists."""
