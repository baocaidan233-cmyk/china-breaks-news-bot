"""Multi-key fallback wrapper for the OpenAI SDK — added 2026-08-07 at the
user's request ("抓新闻和发布时，需要增加open ai key fallback机制，万一一个key
额度用完，可以换第二个续上"). Every agent that talks to OpenAI (Scorer,
Embedder, Writer, PriorityRanker) previously built its own bare AsyncOpenAI(
api_key=config.openai.api_key) — a single exhausted/rate-limited key would
stall every one of them at once. create_openai_client() is a drop-in
replacement: same .chat.completions.create / .embeddings.create surface,
but backed by config.openai.api_keys (primary + optional fallback), retrying
the next key on RateLimitError before giving up.

    malformed key, etc.) surfaces immediately rather than masking a real
    bug behind key-cycling.
