    Populated from a candidate's title+description, using the same

    it is a NEW collection, not a continuation of anything the old n8n
    system wrote to Qdrant. publishedAt is the article's own original
    publish time in Unix seconds, not when this row was written.

    Periodic delete-by-filter cleanup (retention_days) is intentionally NOT

    """Event aggregation collection (qdrant.events_collection, default
    chinabreaks_events) — added 2026-08-06 after the first heat-scoring attempt
    (bucketing QdrantStore's own dedup-query neighbors) turned out to lose
    corroboration credit whenever a near-duplicate article got dropped, and
    to be vulnerable to the two classic Topic-Detection-and-Tracking
    failure modes: cluster fragmentation (a differently-worded report of
    the same event fails to match a single fixed anchor) and semantic
    drift (a multi-day evolving story's phrasing moves away from its own
    first report). See project_am1st_migration memory's 2026-08-06 "event
    aggregation" note for the full design discussion.

    Follows the standard TDT "topic tracking" pattern: an event is a GROUP
    of points sharing one `event_id` payload field — not one fixed vector —
    so new representative points can be added as an event's coverage picks
    up new phrasing over time (mitigates fragmentation/drift), while
    heat_score/first_seen_at/last_updated_at/sources stay in sync across
    every point of that event via one filtered payload update (Qdrant's
    set_payload accepts a Filter as the points selector, so this is a
    single API call regardless of how many representative points an event
    has accumulated).

    Payload per point:
      event_id        — uuid shared by every representative point of this event
      source           — the RSS source name that contributed THIS point
      url              — this point's own article's URL — 2026-08-11, was missing entirely (only chinabreaks_embeddings/chinabreaks_posting_news_embedding had it); the user's own earlier "drop event_time, re-derive from the article URL later if ever needed" reasoning depended on this actually being stored, which it wasn't until now
      published_at     — this point's own article's publish time (unix seconds)
      heat_score        — 1.0 + weighted sum of distinct corroborating sources (kept in sync across the event's points)
      first_seen_at     — earliest published_at seen across the event's sources, unix seconds (can only move earlier)
      last_updated_at   — unix seconds of the most recent corroboration — used as the recency filter for matching, NOT first_seen_at, so a still-developing event stays matchable even if it started outside heat.window_hours
      sources           — list of distinct source names already credited, to avoid double-counting the same outlet re-syndicating its own story
      seed_entities     — entity tokens (core/event_identity.entity_tokens) of this event's FIRST article, set once at creation and never changed — see core/event_identity.py's core_entities_of()
      entity_doc_freq   — {token: how many of this event's own accumulated articles contain it}, updated every commit()
      representative_text — title+description of whichever article was this commit()'s representative — a rolling anchor (updates to the latest), used as the "TEXT A" side of EventVerifier's LLM comparisons
      related_event_ids  — list of link entries, each tagged `source` so the two ways a link gets created stay distinguishable (2026-09-02, see link_related_events()'s docstring for why): `{event_id, cosine_score, linked_at, source: "seed_cosine_reject"}` set once at this event's creation when it exists BECAUSE a cosine-matched, entity-related candidate was ruled DIFFERENT_EVENT (see core/event_identity.py and main.py's 2026-08-10 note) — a breadcrumb, not itself storyline grouping; or `{event_id, title, linked_at, source: "entity_reverse_lookup"}` written any time by link_related_events() — no cosine_score, since that path isn't a vector match at all
      canonical_title, canonical_summary — the seed article's own title/description, set once at creation and never changed (same permanence as seed_entities) — deliberately NOT an LLM-rewritten title/summary; see 2026-08-10 event-identity note: the user explicitly ruled out a new LLM call for this once event_time was dropped from scope
      event_type, canonical_action, actor, target — core/event_identity.extract_event_frame()'s free, no-LLM guess (spaCy dependency parse of the seed article, not an LLM) — set once at creation from `seed_frame`, fail-open to empty string when unclear rather than guessing; NOT re-derived on later commits to the same event

    Vector = whichever article's embedding this particular point represents
    (the first point of an event uses that event's originating article;
    later representative points use whichever new-angle article added
    them) — never a recomputed centroid, per the "fixed representative,
    not rolling average" TDT guidance.

    2026-08-06, same day — split from a single record() into peek() +
    preview_heat() + commit(), after the user flagged that record()'s
    "query, then always write" design wrote an event (or bumped one) for
    EVERY local news cluster regardless of whether anything in that
    cluster would end up politically/thematically relevant — sports
    scores, celebrity gossip, etc. all created event-store noise, since
    llm_score-based relevance is only known AFTER scoring, which itself
    happens after the old record() call. Rather than add a second,
    separate (and imperfect) cheap classifier just to gate the write, this
    reuses the score gate that's ALREADY being paid for: main.py now calls
    peek() (read-only) BEFORE scoring to get a preview heat_score to feed
    the scoring prompt, then calls commit() (the actual write) AFTER
    scoring, and ONLY for a cluster that had at least one member clear the
    score threshold — a cluster where every member scored below threshold
    (irrelevant content) never touches this collection at all. See

        """The actual write — called AFTER scoring, and only for a local
        cluster where at least one member cleared the score gate (see
        main.py). `representative` and each of `extra_points` are now
        (embedding, source, published_at_unix, text, entity_tokens, url) —
        `text` and `entity_tokens` added 2026-08-09 (core/event_identity.py)
        so this event's identity fingerprint (seed_entities/entity_doc_freq)
        and its rolling LLM-comparison anchor (representative_text) can be
        maintained here, instead of re-deriving them from scratch on every
        check by re-reading every past article's text (which is how the
        design was validated in scratchpad, but is not how it should run
        in production — see project_am1st_migration memory's 2026-08-09
        "event identity" note). `url` added 2026-08-11 — was missing
        entirely until the user pointed out the event library has no way
        to go re-read a full article, which the earlier "drop event_time,
        look it up from the URL later" decision had assumed was already
        possible. Each embedding still becomes its own representative
        point sharing one event_id, so future cross-cycle matches can hit
        any of their phrasings, not just the first one (mitigates
        fragmentation/drift, see class docstring).

        `related_links` (2026-08-10, plural since 2026-08-14's Top-K
        redesign) — only passed when `matched` is None BECAUSE the entity
        verifier rejected one or more OTHER candidate events as
        RELATED_DIFFERENT_EVENT while walking main.py's Top-K list (shared/
        hub entities, cosine matched, but a distinct action — e.g.
        "condemns the launch" vs the launch itself): a list of
        `{"event_id": ..., "cosine_score": ...}`, one per rejected
        candidate. Persisted once, at this new event's creation, as a seed
        for storyline linking later — deliberately NOT recorded for a
        NO_OVERLAP rejection, since zero entity relation is more likely an
        unrelated cosine false-positive than a real storyline neighbor.
        This does not itself group events into a storyline — that needs
        its own, separately-thresholded pass (main.py's 2026-08-10 comment)
        — it only keeps the links from being silently discarded before
        that pass exists.

        `seed_frame` (2026-08-10) — core/event_identity.extract_event_frame()
        run on the representative's own title+description, always passed
        by the caller (cheap — no LLM, no I/O) but only consulted when
        `matched` is None: canonical_title/canonical_summary/event_type/
        canonical_action/actor/target get set once from it at this event's
        creation and are never re-derived on later commits, same as
        seed_entities. Deliberately not LLM-generated — see the class
        docstring's payload note on why.

        `heat_multiplier` (2026-08-14) — see preview_heat()'s docstring;
        passed straight through so commit()'s final heat_score exactly
        matches whatever preview_heat() returned earlier for this cluster.

        `hot_until` (2026-08-31) — unix timestamp until which this event
        counts as manually-flagged-hot (core/hot_topics.py, core/config.py's
        HotTopicsConfig), or 0 if this cluster didn't match any currently-
        live flag. The final stored value is max(existing hot_until already
        on a matched event, this call's own hot_until) — so once ANY
        commit to a given event_id has matched a hot-topic flag, every
        later commit to that SAME event_id (future corroborating articles,
        via the usual `matched is not None` carry-forward) inherits hot
        status automatically, without needing to re-match the flag text
        again each time. Never decreases on its own — it only moves
        forward when a fresh match extends it, exactly like heat_score
        only ever accumulating.

        Returns (heat_score, first_seen_at_unix, event_id, core_entities,
        hot_until) — heat_score/first_seen_at_unix should exactly equal
        whatever preview_heat() returned earlier for this same cluster;
        event_id and core_entities (core/event_identity.core_entities_of()
        on the just-written payload) are for the caller to pass to
        HubIndex.bump(); hot_until is the final stored value described
        above, for the caller to derive is_hot = hot_until > now."""
