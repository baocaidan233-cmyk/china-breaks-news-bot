"""Second-opinion check on top of EventStore.peek()'s cosine match — see
core/config.py's EntityVerifierConfig docstring for the full derivation
and why it's shaped this way. Mechanism ported unchanged from AM1ST, where
it was validated on AM1ST's own real historical am1st_events data before
being written this way — China Breaks inherits it as a real starting
point, not yet independently validated against its own chinabreaks_events
data (see EntityVerifierConfig's docstring).

Flow: main.py calls verify_compatibility() first (rule tier, no LLM). If
that comes back AMBIGUOUS, main.py calls EventVerifier.same_event() (the
one LLM call that actually gates whether this candidate gets treated as
the same event). classify_subtype() is a separate, optional second call —
only worth making when same_event() said True, and only for enriching the
logged training record; nothing downstream reads its output yet.

Every decision (rule-tier and LLM-tier) should be passed to log_decision()
by the caller — see that function's docstring for why."""

# Gazetteer-based EntityRuler — mechanism ported unchanged from AM1ST,
# where it was added because en_core_web_sm's statistical NER misses real,
# important people in compressed headline syntax (no title, no verb
# context — e.g. "Colby pushes back on..."; a real production headline
# where the dependency parse correctly found "Colby" as the sentence's
# subject, but it was never tagged PERSON at all, so entity_covering()
# below correctly refused to accept it as an actor).
#
# core/gazetteer_names.json's CONTENT is China Breaks' own, authored fresh
# for this port (see that file) — AM1ST's own gazetteer is 100%
# US-domestic-politics names (Congress/Cabinet), which has no bearing on a
# CCP-exposure feed. This file's categories: ccp_leadership (current
# Politburo Standing Committee + full Politburo + State Council premier/
# vice premiers + Central Military Commission leadership + heads of the
# Ministry of State Security/CCDI/Propaganda Department/Foreign Ministry),
# state_media (Xinhua/CCTV/CGTN/Global Times/People's Daily/China Daily,
# as ORGANIZATION entries, not PERSON — see the ORG-labeled branch below),
# notable (cross-over figures this project's own prompts explicitly name:
# Xi Jinping, Wang Qishan, Han Zheng, the "Big 3" Putin/Trump, plus Orban/
# Lula/Taiwan's Lai Ching-te as named examples in those same prompts),
# us_officials (2026-09-05 addition — the real Trump administration Cabinet
# roster, copied verbatim from AM1ST's own already-vetted "cabinet" list,
# since it's the same real people and this feed's own content-gen prompt
# explicitly prioritizes "if President Trump or America says something
# about China"), world_leaders (2026-09-05 addition — heads of state/
# government who recur in this feed's "Global Pushback"/"Strategic Theater
# Impact" themes: Kim Jong Un, Modi, Marcos, Zelenskyy, Takaichi, von der
# Leyen, Macron, Starmer, Albanese — a starting, not exhaustive, roster;
# unlike AM1ST's single-legislature Congress list there's no one governing
# body to enumerate exhaustively for a multi-country geopolitics feed, so
# expand this from real ingested-article entity misses during testing
# rather than trying to front-load every foreign ministry's full roster),
# aliases (short forms not derivable by splitting a full name, e.g.
# "William Lai" for the already-listed "Lai Ching-te", "Bongbong Marcos"
# and "Kim Jong-un" likewise for their 2026-09-05 world_leaders entries).
#
# Only full-name patterns are added for any entry whose `short_form` is
# null — same convention AM1ST used for its own Cabinet/notable entries
# (e.g. "Mehmet Oz" -> null, since "Oz" alone collides with the "oz."
# weight abbreviation): here, nulled out wherever a bare given-name-order
# surname would collide with another entry in this same file (e.g. the
# several Politburo members surnamed Li/Wang/Zhang/Chen/He — a bare "Li"
# or "Wang" pattern would be too ambiguous to mean any one of them).
#
# 2026-09-05 FIX (previously flagged, now closed — see
# project_china_breaks_bot memory): entity_tokens()'s PERSON-span handling
# below keeps only the LAST word of a multi-word span, which is correct
# for Western given-name-last order but wrong for Chinese (and Vietnamese-
# style) surname-FIRST names — "Xi Jinping" was truncating to "jinping"
# instead of the surname "xi" real headlines actually use for shorthand.
# Fixed via _PERSON_SHORT_FORMS below: any PERSON span whose full text
# exactly matches a gazetteer full_name uses that entry's own short_form
# instead of blindly taking the span's last word. Only covers names
# actually in the gazetteer — an unlisted CJK name recognized by
# statistical NER alone still falls back to the old (wrong-for-CJK) last-
