# 2026-08-20: ported from North_Korea_News's core/hashing.py (commit
# 1caea63, "Add IDF-weighted keyword overlap as a semantic-dedup support
# signal") — that bot missed a real duplicate because two writeups of the
# same event (same official quoted, different phrasing) only scored 0.7172
# cosine, under its 0.8 dedup bar. Generic-word overlap alone false-
# positived on ~34% of same-band pairs there (validated against 642 real
# published items) until weighted by rarity — IDF-weighted overlap instead
# discounts words that are common across the whole corpus ("North Korea",
# "Trump") and rewards ones that are rare/identifying.
#
# Used here (by way of AM1ST, which this codebase was ported from) as a
# second, entity-independent lexical signal for core/event_identity.py's
# verify_compatibility() FAIL_OPEN branch — that branch previously just
# blindly trusted whatever cosine match EventStore handed it whenever NER
# extracted zero entity tokens (very short text, or a genuine NER miss),
# with no independent check at all. NOTE: the specific threshold below is
# carried over from North_Korea_News's own real-data validation by way of
# AM1ST, not (yet) independently validated against China Breaks' own
# historical chinabreaks_events data — see EntityVerifierConfig's docstring.
