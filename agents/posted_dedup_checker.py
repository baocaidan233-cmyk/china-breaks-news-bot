    but only 0.698 with the URL included, missing the duplicate entirely.

    present (defensive, shouldn't happen given how post_content is built)."""

    """Walks `ranked_batch` in priority order (highest first) and returns the
    first candidate that is NOT a near-duplicate of something this channel
    already posted in the last publish.posted_dedup_window_hours. Duplicates
    (and candidates whose dedup check itself failed — see Fallback below)
    are skipped (logged only, not written anywhere) — never causes the whole
    cycle to abort. Returns None only if every candidate in the batch was a
    duplicate or errored (or the batch is empty) — the correct outcome for
    an actual all-duplicate batch is "publish nothing this cycle", not a
    fallback that fakes freshness.

    2026-09-06, ported from AM1ST's own 2026-09-05 fix: cosine similarity
    alone no longer decides a duplicate — it only decides whether to ASK. A
    real production audit on AM1ST's own feed found cosine > threshold
    flags genuine next-stage developments in an ongoing story as duplicates
    of the earlier stage just as often as it flags actual reprints (a state
    court ruling vs. its own federal appeal; a construction announcement vs.
    a legal challenge trying to halt it — both got silently dropped as
    duplicates in production, cascading the actual winner down to a much
    weaker, unrelated story). The exact same failure mode applies here: a
    CCP sanctions package vs. a court challenge to it, or a Belt-and-Road
    financing announcement vs. a recipient country's own confirmation, look
    equally similar in embedding space to cosine alone.

    core/event_identity.py's EventVerifier.same_event() already exists for
    exactly this question (used at ingestion time to decide whether two
    articles describe the same occurrence) and already carries this
    project's stage-distinction guidance (prompts/same_event_prompt.txt) —
    reused here as-is, no new prompt, no keyword heuristics. Only called
    when cosine > threshold (rare per publish cycle), so the added cost is
    negligible.

    Rule-tier pre-filter: before asking the LLM, check has_date_conflict()
    (core/event_identity.py) — if both sides name a single explicit "Month
    Day" date and they disagree, that's strong independent evidence of a
    different specific occurrence regardless of how similar the text
    otherwise reads, so skip the LLM call and treat as NOT duplicate
    outright. Deliberately NOT adding the mirror-image shortcut (skip the
    LLM and assume duplicate above some high cosine/entity-overlap cutoff)
    — AM1ST's own same-day data argued against it: a real story scored
    0.738-0.747 cosine against an older, unrelated story across several
    cycles (all wrongly auto-flagged "duplicate" under a pure-cosine rule)
    before same_event() correctly called it DIFFERENT_EVENT at a similar
    score — i.e. the exact cosine/entity-overlap range that would tempt a
    "confident duplicate" shortcut is also where a real false positive just
    happened. Revisit only once enough same_event()-adjudicated
    posted_dedup pairs accumulate to bucket-calibrate a genuinely safe
    floor, the same way no_overlap_llm_review_floor was calibrated — not
    before, and not by copying AM1ST's own number blind.

    Fallback: same_event() is a real OpenAI call with no fail-open wrapper
    of its own — any error (a timeout or a malformed response) propagates.
    Without this fallback, that exception would escape find_publishable()
    entirely and abort the WHOLE cycle via main_publish.py's run_cycle()
    exception handler — turning one transient API hiccup on candidate #1
    into zero publishes this cycle, even if candidates #2-#10 never needed
    an LLM call at all. Each candidate's whole dedup check (embedding,
    posted-history lookup, same_event()) is now wrapped in its own
    try/except: on any failure, that ONE candidate is skipped (logged as
    check_type=posted_dedup_error, not conflated with a real "duplicate"
    verdict) and the walk continues to the next-ranked candidate, so the
    cycle still very likely finds something to publish."""
