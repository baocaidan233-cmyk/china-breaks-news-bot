    standing "gpt-4o-mini everywhere" rule. AM1ST's own history already
    tried moving this role (and every other subjective-judgment call in
    this codebase) onto a cheaper gpt-5-nano model and reverted after a
    live multi-cycle test found real judgment failures across the board
    (Scorer scored clearly off-theme content as passing; EventVerifier's
    related_event()/same_event() both misjudged real pairs, in opposite
    directions) — see agents/scorer.py's docstring. That lesson is
    inherited here rather than re-tested.
