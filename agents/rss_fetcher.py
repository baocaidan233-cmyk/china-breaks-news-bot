# baltimoresun.com — all Tribune Publishing) still 403'd even under a real
# browser render (a harder bot-detection vendor, not just a UA check) —
# deliberately not added here, not worth chasing further. keysnews.com
# 429'd (rate-limited, not blocked) — also not a fit for this list, needs
# a lower poll frequency instead, not a browser render.
