class GettrPublisher:
    """Text-only post — ported unchanged from AM1ST, whose own workflow
    never attaches media, so post_content is the entire payload. Same
    multipart/x-app-auth publish mechanism as the sibling bots (see
    russia_news/agents/gettr_publisher.py). No real Gettr credentials are
    configured for this build — the real live channel this bot is meant
    to eventually drive (username "chinabreaks") is documented in README
    as reference info only.

    Includes the link-preview fields (dsc/previmg/prevsrc/ttl) — without
    them, Gettr renders the appended article URL as plain text with no
    preview card at all (confirmed on AM1ST via a real screenshot). These
    four field names aren't documented anywhere; found by reading
    DN_Video_Scraper_Agent/services/gettr_client.py's
    `_build_post_without_media`, which was itself ported from a real n8n
    workflow node ("Prepare Gettr Post w/o Media") and is confirmed
    working there. Gettr rejects the whole post if any of these four are
    sent as an empty string rather than omitted entirely — see the `if`
    guards in _build_payload below, matching that reference implementation."""
