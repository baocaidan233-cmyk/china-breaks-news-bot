"""Fetches Open Graph metadata (title/description/image) for a Gettr
link-preview card — see agents/gettr_publisher.py's docstring for why
AM1ST's own posts (this codebase's architecture origin) showed no
preview until this existed: Gettr's post payload needs explicit
dsc/previmg/prevsrc/ttl fields, which nothing in that project populated
before it was added there.

Ported from AM1ST, which itself ported this from
DN_Video_Scraper_Agent/agents/publish_agent.py's _fetch_og_metadata/
_fetch_og_via_caps_gettr (confirmed working there, against real Gettr
posts) — adapted from aiohttp to httpx, and trimmed of that project's
site-specific bits (cls.cn's JSON API shape, Google News URL resolution)
that don't apply to either AM1ST's or China Breaks' own RSS sources."""

# CJK Unicode ranges — used to reject an og:title/og:description that came
# back in Chinese/Japanese/Korean. Ported unchanged from AM1ST, where a
# real incident confirmed the failure mode: a paywalled article returned
# HTTP 200 for a login/paywall interstitial page instead of the real
# article on one fetch attempt — that interstitial's own og:title happened
# to be in Chinese while its og:description was still in English, and both
# got taken at face value, producing a post with a Chinese headline on an
# English-only channel. This applies at least as directly to China Breaks
# (English-only output, same posture as AM1ST) even though some of its own
# underlying source articles may genuinely be Chinese-language — the
# PREVIEW CARD shown alongside an English-language post must itself be in
# English regardless of the source article's own language, so a mostly-CJK
# OG value is still the signal that either the wrong page got scraped, or
# the right page's own preview metadata isn't usable for this channel —
# not a value worth showing either way, so it's treated as "not found"
# rather than passed through.
